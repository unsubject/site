Can you be truly aware? 

If we are not truly mindful, why?

If we are distracted, isn't it what we want to focus on something, just something different?

So we are not distracted, we are just bored. 

We want something more interesting. 

A lot of people are looking for something. 

And looking for something is boring. 

There is nothing outside. 

There is nothing inside.

There is nothing.

Nothing is boring.

Boring is nothing.

Life is Boring.

Boring is Life.

Life is nothing.

Nothing is live.
