title: What is Unsubject?
permalink: /about/

I founded Unsubject LLC in 2023 with the goal of revolutionizing education. True to its name, Unsubject isn’t limited by traditional boundaries—it embraces a wide range of fields, from economics and finance to history, philosophy, political science, psychology, technology, business, the arts, and sciences. I want to push beyond the conventional online education model, and in the near future, my biggest ambitions are to gamify the learning experience, integrate practical application, and make learning a community-driven journey.
